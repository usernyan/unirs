# UNIRS
UNIRS, UserNyan's Incredible Ricing Script, automatically installs my desktop environment under a given user on your arch linux system.

Run it with `sudo ./unirs.sh'`

This project borrows heavily from Luke Smith's LARBS.

This project is still in development, and doesn't install an entire system with full documentation yet!

Some features:
- Transparency on the status bar, terminal, and web browser (firefox)
- Quick shortcuts to mounting, internet, and audio control.
