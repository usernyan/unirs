# UNIRS
Unirs, UserNyan's Incredible Ricing Script, automatically installs my desktop environment under a given user on your arch linux system.

This project borrows heavily from Luke Smith's LARBS.

This project is still in development, and doesn't install an entire system with full documentation yet!
